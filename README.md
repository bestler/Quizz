## Learning objectives

It is part of the learning process of app development for iOS. The primary objective of this project is to develop a better understanding of:

- API-Calls in Swift (usage of async/await)
- Develop a better understanding for Data structuring in Swift (and using the Design Pattern MVVM with multiple ViewModels)
- Getting used to develop with Accessibility in mind (VoiceOver is supported)
- Develop a cross-platform application (iPhone and iPad are supported)

## Data source
